<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Our RecipeGenius is a tool that allows users to find amazing recipes based on a set of customizable criteria. Using natural language processing techniques and a database of ingredients and cooking techniques, the tool is capable of finding a wide variety of dishes, from classic comfort foods to exotic international cuisines.

Whether you're looking for inspiration for your next meal, trying to use up ingredients in your pantry, or just want to try something new, our tool can help. We hope that our RecipeGenius will inspire you to explore new flavors and experiment in the kitchen.

## Concepts
The dataset was reformatted according to the project's specifications, followed by filtering the recipes based on the frequency of ingredient usage. This technique effectively eliminated rare ingredients from consideration. The following plotly plot shows the most commonly used ingredients and their counts.

<image src="https://github.com/Zeemal-Nadeem/AI_Project/blob/master/images/plotly.png">

The data is then divided into 10 chunks, with each chunk containing a fixed number of ingredients. For instance, "chunk_5" includes recipes made with only 5 ingredients, and so forth. Subsequently, an embeddings neural network is trained on each data chunk, ensuring that each model learns from vectors of the same length. The diagram below illustrates the process of training a model on a data chunk and utilizing the weight matrix of the embeddings layer to create embeddings for that specific chunk.

<p align="center">
  <image src="https://github.com/Zeemal-Nadeem/AI_Project/blob/master/images/embeddings%20creation.png" width="500" height="350">
</p>
  
By employing this methodology, each model can effectively learn and generate embeddings tailored to the specific length of ingredients within its assigned data chunk. The next step involves finding similarities between the user's input ingredients and the recipe ingredients within a chunk. The diagram below illustrates the process:

1) The user ingredient vector is first transformed into an embedding using the weight matrix of the relevant model.
2) Cosine similarities are calculated between the user embeddings and the recipe embeddings.
3) The similarities are then sorted in descending order.
  
By following this approach, the system can determine the most similar recipes based on ingredient matching.
  
<p align="center">
  <image src="https://github.com/Zeemal-Nadeem/AI_Project/blob/master/images/cosine%20similarities.png" width="500" height="350">
</p>
  
The following diagram illustrates the entire project workflow. At the end, the similarity lists generated by all models are merged and sorted. The top "n" recipes are then displayed to the user. The merging of similarity results is particularly noteworthy as it allows the most relevant model to yield high similarity scores. In the event that one model fails to identify suitable recipes, other models can potentially find the relevant and most appropriate options for the user. In essence, all models collaborate to enhance accuracy.

<!-- Accuracy -->
## Accuracy Measure

Accuracy measurement poses a significant challenge in this project, and two methods are employed to address it:

1) Offline queries: These involve providing predetermined inputs to assess the model's output.
2) Online testing: This entails allowing users to evaluate the model during real-world usage.
  
The RecipeGenius model undergoes offline testing to evaluate its accuracy. However, a challenge arises when determining suitable inputs for testing the model. Random ingredient combinations, such as "beef," "oreo," and "mango," do not make sense, rendering it difficult for the model to predict relevant outputs for such queries. To overcome this, a Genetic Algorithm is employed to generate appropriate inputs for evaluation purposes.
